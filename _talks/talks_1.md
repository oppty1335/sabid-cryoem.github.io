**Abstract:**<br>
This talk aims to cover the implementation and the application of the Turing machine briefly. The full content of this talk is taught at the undergrad level course on theoretical computer science. Initially, it gives a brief history of Alan Turing, the father of computers. After that, it introduces the finite state machine and Turing machine by their definitions and examples. The second half of the talk focus on the proof of the decision problem. It points out that although the Turing machine became a universal computer model, the Turing machine was invented to construct the logic proof of decision problem. Lastly, the talk introduces the P versus NP problem, which is yet to be solved. Overall, this is a prerequisite to the next topic on computer architecture because modern computers are based on the Turing machine.
