**Abstract:**<br>
This lecture will focus on the implementation of single-cycle CPU architecture using MIPS assembly. The prerequisite of this lecture is basic knowledge of the Turing machine. In this lecture, I will cover CMOS transistors and MIPS CPU. The first half of the lecture would introduce CMOS transistors and uses transistors to build logic gates. After that, it covers how to construct combinational circuits and sequential circuits using logic gates. This would conclude all the tools needed for a CPU. The second half of the lecture would focus on the assembly language and MIPS CPU. It points out that assembly language is a finite state machine, and the registers are the Turing machine tape. Finally, it would go over how a CPU works under MIPS single cycle architecture. In summary, this lecture covers the smallest computing unit, CMOS, all the way to CPU design, and it is a prerequisite to the next topic on quantum computers.
